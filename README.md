# WebStorm Color Scheme

![Alt text](/golbin/master/screenshot.png?raw=true "Base16 Ocean +")

It's for JavaScript based on Base16.

And I don't use indent guides. You can disable it below;

    Settings -> Editor -> Appearance -> Show vertical indent guides

Usage:

    File -> Import Settings -> Select "settings.jar"
